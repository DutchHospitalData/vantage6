Deploy
^^^^^^

The vantage6 server is a Flask application, that uses
`python-socketio <https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io>`_ for socketIO
connections. The server runs as a standalone process (listening on its own ip
address/port).

There are many deployment options. We simply provide a few examples.

-  :ref:`deploy-nginx`
-  :ref:`deploy-docker-compose`
-  â€¦

.. note::
    Because the server uses socketIO to exchange messages with the nodes and
    users, it is not trivial to horizontally scale the server. To prevent that
    socket messages get lost:

        * you should deploy a RabbitMQ service and configure the server to use it.
          :ref:`This section <rabbitmq-install>` explains how to do so.
        * you should ensure sticky sessions are enabled in your load balancer.

.. _deploy-nginx:

NGINX
"""""

A basic setup is shown below. This example shows how to configure NGINX where there
are 3 backend servers that are load balanced. The load balancer is configured to use
sticky sessions.

Note that SSL is not configured in this example.

.. code:: nginx

   upstream backend {
       server backend1.example.com;
       server backend2.example.com;
       server backend3.example.com;

       sticky name=sessionid path=/;
   }

   server {

       # Public port
       listen 80;
       server_name _;

       # vantage6-server. In the case you use a sub-path here, make sure to forward also
       # it to the proxy_pass
       location /subpath {
           include proxy_params;

           # internal ip and port
           proxy_pass http://backend/subpath;
       }

       # Allow the websocket traffic
       location /socket.io {
           include proxy_params;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
           proxy_pass http://backend/socket.io;
       }
   }

.. note::
    When you :ref:`server-configure` the server, make
    sure to include the ``/subpath`` that has been set in the NGINX
    configuration into the ``api_path`` setting
    (e.g. ``api_path: /subpath/api``)

.. _deploy-docker-compose:

Docker compose
""""""""""""""

An alternative to ``v6 server start`` is to use docker-compose. Below is an
example of a ``docker-compose.yml`` file that may be used to start the server.
Obviously, you may want to change this to your own situation. For example, you
may want to use a different image tag, or you may want to use a different port.

.. code:: yaml

    services:
      vantage6-server:
        image: harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/server:cotopaxi
        ports:
        - "8000:5000"
        volumes:
        - /path/to/my/server.yaml:/mnt/config.yaml
        command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/vantage6/vantage6-server/server.sh"]
