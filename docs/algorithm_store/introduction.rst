What is an algorithm store?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using vantage6, it is important to know which algorithms are available
to you. This is why vantage6 has algorithm stores. An algorithm store contains
metadata about the algorithms so that you can easily find the algorithm you
need, and know how to use it.

There is a community algorithm store, which is by default available to all
collaborations. This store is maintained by the vantage6 community. You can
also create your own algorithm store. This allows you to create a private
algorithm store, which is only available to your own collaborations.

Linking algorithm stores
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Algorithm stores can be linked to a vantage6 server or to a specific
collaboration on a server. If an algorithm store is linked to a server, the
algorithms in the store are available to all collaborations on that server. If
an algorithm store is linked to a collaboration, the algorithms in the store
are only available to that collaboration.

Users can link algorithm stores to a collaboration if they have permission to
modify that collaboration. Algorithm stores can only be linked to a server by
users that have permission to modify all collaborations on the server.
